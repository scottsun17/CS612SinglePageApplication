        Fine, sure, and okay. Here comes the movie that will ruin Pokemon for us all, at once. Mr. Mime is just straight up creepy. He will be a better character in the horror movie, IT. Lickitung's skin should be censored in the movie. This is just gonna cause me endless nightmare seeing his/her bumpy slimy skin while his gaint tounge licks your face??? That would be life-long trauma..

        The only pokemon looks normal in the preview is probably Pikachu, but I am not sure his sassy attitude is what actual Pikachu has. Seems like a lot of complaining but I am actually every excited to see this movie, cause!!! IT IS POKEMON.. let's all go to the movie and have nightmare about Mr.Mine and Lickitung licking us..
        oh boy..
