        The eighth and the final season of Game of Thrones is finally coming back after two years of waiting! Spoiler alert!! This post may or may not contains spoilers!!
        We see that Jon snow finally found out that he is not a Stark but a Targaryen! He is the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, the late Prince of Dragonstone. How is he gonna reacted to the news? Is he gonna marry his aunt?
        We also see that the behated Cersei Lannister is not going to support the war against the white walkers! How can a character be so hateful and mean? Do you think he is worse than Joffrey Baratheon? I cannot wait to see her die a horrible death!
        I hope you also noticed the tension between Sansa Stark and Jon Snow. Since now snow find out he is a Targaryen not a Stark. Would Sansa finally becomes the Lord of the North?
